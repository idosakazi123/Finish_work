##v1.1.1 - 18.01.2017 ##

- i messed up publishing in last two versions and got so confused
that probably everything is broken (npm-wise)
well, live and learn i guess, now should be okay
##v1.1.0 - 17.01.2017 ##

- add feature of providing controller function for modal content
- rewrite/refactor most of the code, and make modal into directive
##v1.0.4 - 17.01.2017 ##

- add this changelog, but more importantly examples/ folder  
##v1.0.3 - 16.01.2017 ##

- fix a bug preventing modal from closing by backdrop click
it is directly related to v1.0.2 as i forgot to change id used  
to check for $event origin
##v1.0.2 - 13.01.2017 ##

- add prefix 'nsm-' to both id's in modal template to avoid  
potential conflicts with user's styles
##v1.0.1 - 12.01.2017 ##

- actually kinda mistake - in the heath of the moment i treated  
updating README.md (with information about npm) as a patch change.  
Sorry.
##v1.0.0 - 12.01.2017 ##

- added package.json
- published repo on npm
